            <p>Adams was born in Canada in 1959 to British parents. His father Conrad J.
                Adams was active in the military diplomatic service, his mother Elisabeth
                Jane Watson worked as a teacher and librarian. Because of the father's
                occupation, the family had to move frequently; for example, they lived in
                Israel and Austria and from 1967 to 1971 in Portugal . The parents separated
                in the mid-1970s. Bryan Adams moved to Ottawa and a little later to Vancouver
                with his mother and two years younger brother . In addition to English,
                he also speaks French .</p>
